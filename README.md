## Example Scripts which I worked with my friend Juan to come up with.

This is intended to show skill levels, knowledge, and serve as examples
of construct similarities across the three scripting languages Perl,
Python and Ruby.  Other examples may be added later, but the main
theme of the simple log filtering app is the focus.  The focus is on
language use, and helpful critical feedback that helps us improve our
exercise is of course welcome, and will be cited at the bottom of the
readme, or somewhere else which is obvious.
